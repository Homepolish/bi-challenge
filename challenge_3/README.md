# Challenge 3
For this challenge, you will be using the same Docker container as Challenge 2.

In the `marketing` database, there is a table named `maryland_purchases` that
shows monthly sales information.

## Task 1
AEP has decided to invest in this service, and is trying to identify the most
effective time to launch. First, we'd like to know when people are drinking
more overall.

From the `maryland_purchases` data, identify any yearly trends in overall
alcohol sales and identify any "hot spots" we can target.

## Task 2
We are interested more specifically in whisky. From the data, isolate the yearly
trends and hot spots in whisky sales, and tell us if they are the same or
different from the overall trends.

You are free to use whatever criteria you come up with to identify a product as
a whisky, so long as it makes sense and the results are accurate. The products
do not necessarily need to be matched up with previous results, but bonus points
if they do.

## Task 3
We're worried that we've been keeping you handcuffed. Task 3 is to do anything
you want with these datasets to provide any analysis you think would be relevant
to us. You can work within this data or bring in any additional data you think
would be helpful.

The point here is not to invest a lot of effort carrying out a thorough analysis,
but to identify an important insight that has been missed in these challenges
and to provide that additional perspective.

Generate a last report that summarizes your findings through these challenges.
