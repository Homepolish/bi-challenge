# Challenge 1
Aperture Entertainment Portal provides curated event planning services for our
clients. We are exploring the addition of "premium" whisky-themed packages to
our services, and would like to find out more about which products we should be
looking at.

In this directory, you will find a csv with whisky review information[1].

## Task 1
Identify the top 10 (plus ties) highest rated whiskies within the following price
ranges:
* <$60
* $60-$90
* $90-$120
* $120-$200

## Task 2
For each whisky producer, we want to know how many of the top products from task
1 they make. We would like to see a list of the top producers in each price
range, as well as the top producers across all ranges.

## Task 3
We don't feel that looking at the top rated products in these price tiers quite
captures the sense of premium products we are looking for. Can you come up
with a different way of measuring which products are the "most premium", and
which producers carry the most premium products?

## Bonus
Provide dashboards so the company leadership can further explore the data.
